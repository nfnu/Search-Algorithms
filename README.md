# Path Planning for a Rover in 3D Space

The goal of the project was to find the most optimal path that a rover should take from a landing site to multiple target sites given a 3D space terrain map with obstacles by using search algorithms. The complete program was developed in Python.

This code was among the top 5% in terms of speed and efficiency in CSCI 561 - Foundations of Artificial Intelligence, USC Fall 2019 class.
